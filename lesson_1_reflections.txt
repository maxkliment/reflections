How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It made easy finding the particular line of code with a typo. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It is wasy to revert some changes that you think were unnecessary, instead of having to rewrite the code. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
You can logically seperate commits.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git is designed for programmers, that would like to make changes in several connected files, while other version control systems are designed for other purposes.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
